Just started hacking a bit with tRPC and Next 13. 

This is not anywhere closed to the finished design and just a playground for our own exploration.


## Overview

- `/@trpc/*` represent an imaginary trpc lib for Next 13
- Feel free to add whatever you want to get a feel of Next 13 + tRPC combo
- Deployed at [rsc.trpc.io](https://rsc.trpc.io/)



See the [Issues](https://github.com/trpc/next-13/issues) for things we want to hack on
